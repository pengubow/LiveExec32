# LiveExec32
Run 32-bit binaries on 64-bit iOS by passing through syscalls.

Not all apps will work and will mostly run into missing symbols issue. Please open an issue for that.

This project is heavily based on [unidbg](https://github.com/zhkl0228/unidbg).

There are also missing syscalls that I have yet to provide to pass through. Please see [ARM32SyscallHandler.java](https://github.com/zhkl0228/unidbg/blob/master/unidbg-ios/src/main/java/com/github/unidbg/ios/ARM32SyscallHandler.java) and [DarwinSyscallHandler.java](https://github.com/zhkl0228/unidbg/blob/master/unidbg-ios/src/main/java/com/github/unidbg/ios/DarwinSyscallHandler.java) to implement them properly.

## Usage

Build with Theos, CMake, and Boost 1.57 or newer. See the
[build guide](docs/building.md) for SDK requirements and classic linker setup.

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
gmake -C GuestMakefile generate-shims
gmake -C GuestMakefile
./GuestMakefile/pack-ramdisk.sh
gmake
```

On the iOS device, launch an ARM32 binary with the installed app's executable:

```bash
/path/to/LiveExec32.app/LiveExec32 /path/to/arm32-binary
```

- [Building](docs/building.md): prerequisites, downloads, guest RootFS, and macOS testing.
- [Configuration and diagnostics](docs/configuration.md): logging, guest environment, and SDK/UIKit compatibility.
- [Objective-C proxy bridge](docs/ObjCProxy.md): architecture, ownership, and ABI details.
- [Compatibility reports](docs/compatibility/): game testing, fixes, and remaining issues.

## Design
- LiveExec32 has most of the codebase and references from [unidbg](https://github.com/zhkl0228/unidbg), so it also uses Dynarmic as the dynamic translator of ARMv7 code to ARM64.
- The entry point starts from dyld, so it has all of dyld APIs isolated from that of host.
- In `CallSVC`, it goes through a long list of guest functions that copy memory regions from input and to output using a page table. Perhaps page bound checks can be added to allow fastpath memory access.
- Has a crash reporter and symbolicator for guest code.
- Can emulate bind mount points
- More to be explored...

### Guest framework sources

Hand-written guest framework code lives in `GuestFrameworks/<Framework>` and
is tracked. `GuestFrameworks/.generated/<Framework>` is recreated by
`GuestMakefile/generate-shims.sh` and is intentionally ignored; do not commit
files from it. The signatures for 13 private UIKit fallback classes are
captured in `Generator/templates/generated.plist`, so Linux and macOS
generate the same guest class and method set. On macOS the optional Catalyst
runtime pass keeps those captured classes.

## FAQ
### Can this be used to run 32-bit apps & integrate to LiveContainer?
Yes. The bundled Dynarmic revision includes the dual-mapping/TXM JIT path
required by iOS 26+, while non-iOS hosts remain single-mapped by default.

### Will this be available as a jailbreak tweak?
Yes eta now. During install, LiveExec32 shim is injected to the pending 32-bit
app so installd doesn't reject it and makes everything easier to handle.

## Will this allow running encrypted 32-bit apps (ie directly installed from App Store)?
Idk, need to research into this next
